Simple AC3 algorithm in C

User can create 2-100 variables, the domain's size is [1,X], X must be greater than 1. 
Then user has to add the constraints between the variables.
Variables' names are 0,1,2 etc.

In the Results.png, you can see the code's results in the example from Constraint Satisfaction: the AC-3 algorithm, by John Levine
